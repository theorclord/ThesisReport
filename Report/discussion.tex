\subsection{Future work}
In this part, we will discuss what possible work could be done in the future. What we would like to implement, thought on how to do that, and what could have been done differently in order to make this easier in the future.
\subsubsection{Better use of saved data}
One of the big impacts this project brought to light, was the use of saved events and its data to generate new events that were based on those. In this solution, we save the events that happen over the course of the game, and we use them in a rather minimalistic way, more as a proof of concept. However, it would be interesting to see how this data could be used more efficiently over an entire game session. Generating more experience driven content, that would have a bigger impact on the players' experience, by creating other mechanics in the game, is one thought that comes to mind. 

In stead of using only the faction and location type of a given island-event to select premade special events, using all the data in some smart way and maybe generate new pieces, rewards and penalties could prove useful? 

Scaling the difficulty of the events based on the resources and rewards the players have gotten up till any given point in the game.

Increasing amount of rewards depending on how far in the game you are.

\subsubsection{More options and outcomes}
At his point in time, there are a finite number of possible outcome types, rewards and penalties. For a future version of the game, it would be interesting to see how the game would be experienced if there were more types of tokens to be played around with. It would also be nice to have more flavor text pieces that could be combined, maybe in a new way, and presented to the players. Right now, there are somewhere around 3-7 text strings for each board piece, and all of them are able to be combined with each other. Having more pieces, variety of flavor, and ways of combining the flavor, would be like creating an expansion pack of cards that would be added to the physical board game. 

\subsection{PCG contribution and it's benefits}
What the PCG part did for this project, was to remove the need for the physical part of the game to have cards, map-board, a pre-written explanation on how to set up the map locations, and it removed the need for dice rolls. This being a collaborative game, the focus of the players needed to be more on each other and the "story" of the game, rather than having to focus on reading from a piece of paper each turn, each time one rolls a die, and each time a card would be picked and had to be combined.

One of the biggest ways tht PCG has contributed to the game, is the fact that it gives the game access to memory. This means that the game can suddenly surprise the players by presenting a newly generated event, that is based on occurrences that happened maybe 15 turns ago. Unless the players have a book to write down every little detail of the story as the game unfolds, this would not be a very likely scenario without PCG. 
Having memory also opens up for the possibility of hiding information from players. Take the faction system for example: most of the information is hidden, and the only thing the players see is the little dialog box that pops up when a faction's allegiance has been changed from one to another. This means that the only information the players have available is their current standing with the factions, and they will have to remember it themselves, as there is currently no way to see the current standing with any given faction, except for when said faction standing is changed. 


\subsection{App vs. boardgame design challenges}
\subsection{Benefits of having memory in the app}
\subsection{Possible alternatives to our solution}
One of the most obvious alternatives to our solution, is to create a complete board game, or a complete digital game, instead of using both as a hybrid.
