An introduction to the name of our game



Some researchers try to think about analogue and digital games as a whole, and prefer talking about play as an activity instead of making a clear distinction between the two. This theory is crafted so that game studies are not distorted by the tendency of people to think about games in terms of mechanics or support (Stenros and Waern, 2010). In reality however, digital and analogue games are generally thought as two isolated categories of games.
