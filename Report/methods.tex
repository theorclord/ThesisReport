\section{Methods}
The progress and process of the project
\subsection{Brainstorming and design choices}
Co-op game 
Encourage discussion and exploit the tabletop setting (players sitting around a table)
2 phases game (management phase / exploration phase / resource input)
How the app could be used
\subsection{The Game - One play session}
From start to end. Full run of a game.
\subsection{Game design}
Extract/Specify the design patterns (of the 2 genres we are trying to "combine")
Designing how the app would work
Setting
Management system
Resources
Player Specialization
Risk/Reward
Infinite number of cards (events)
Event "memory"
Special events
UX (App/Board)
\subsection{App structure (How the game is composed (Technical))}
Scenes and their purpose
UI elements
Camera
Datamanager
World Nodes and Sub Nodes
Map Layout, spacing and placement
Raycasting?
\subsection{PCG Generating the content}
\subsubsection{L-system}
\subsubsection{Events}
Combining the flavor text
Conditions and Outcomes (How they are connected)
Problem solving
Paper prototypes of building blocks(Strings)
Reverse engineering of text
Finding an acceptable way to combine
Saving data to produce new data
Having the right values
What is needed
How to access
How to build from it
\subsection{The app - From start to end}
The life of the app. 
Start game 
Generate nodes
Generate events
How an event is built
Moving around
Interacting with the islands
Flavor text combinations and it's purpose
Using memory to generate special event occurrences
